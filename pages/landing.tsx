                  I started coding at the age of 15 and never stopped since
                  then.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When I was in highschool I used to code in visual basic 5 and
                  that&apos;s when my interest in building nice interfaces was
                  born. Later on, I had my first experience with web development
                  on a bootcamp at{" "}

                  experience.

                  <br />
                  I also studied Systems Engeneering at UTN, the National
                  Technology University of Argentina.
                  <br />
                  This was a great experience that helped me shape my knowledge
                  in different engeneering areas. However, I dropped in 2018
                  when I felt I wouldnt be able to carry both my formal studies
                  and my fulltime job.

                  When I am not facing a computer screen, I enjoy singing(used
                  to have a band), going for a walk with my dog Penny, playing
                  padel or watching TV shows with my girlfriend.
